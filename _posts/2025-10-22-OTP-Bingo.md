[One Time Passcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) (OTPs) are very useful for keeping accounts secure, but tedious to enter repeatedly over the day. Add some fun to them with OTP Bingo!

The game is simple, every time you have to enter a few digits for your OTP check your bingo card for them. When you have filled out enough to complete a row or column shout BINGO as loud as you can. OTPs come in quite a few different flavours, but you should be able to adapt them to a good game of bingo using the script in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/fred-cook/357a9167edcb359fefa892fb356601a0).

```bash
uv run --with reportlab bingo.py --help

usage: bingo.py [-h] [--grid-size GRID_SIZE] [--max-value MAX_VALUE] [--total-cards TOTAL_CARDS] [--output OUTPUT]
                [--add-free]
