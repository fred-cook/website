title: 🎵 Music League

For the past couple of years I have been running a music league at work. All of the hard work is done by the [music league app](https://musicleague.com/user-guide/), all I have to do is come up with 10 themes and set up the timing schedule for players to submit songs and vote. Then, each week, players have two days to think of and submit a song for the weeks theme (e.g. song with a colour in the title), and five days to vote on the playlist of songs. Players get 10 upvotes and 3 downvotes to to assign to the songs as they see fit, although these numbers can be configured by the league admin. The rounds in the latest league were:

- 🤝 Best song with feat.
- 🐯 Song with an animal in the title
- 👩‍🤝‍🧑 Bands with siblings song
- 🥫  Best product placement/use of a brand name
- 🍦 Answer the question with a title: Why are you sticky?
- 🪦 Least appropriate for a funeral
- ⛵ Sea themed
- 💃 Just dance: songs that instruct the listener to dance
- ♻️ "In the style of" (cover that's not in the original genre)
- 💎 Deep cut - lesser known song from a big band

At the end of 10 weeks the winner is declared, and they receive the **pass the aux cable** trophy:

I also crunch a load of stats for the music league. The code for the stats can be found [here](https://github.com/fred-cook/music-league-graphs), and includes voting correlation matrices, genre correlation between players, song ages etc...
